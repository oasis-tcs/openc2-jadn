## Purpose
Define:
* A data model specifying the characteristics of data used within applications
* A schema mechanism to constrain and validate the content of data instances
* Multiple schema formats to represent data type definitions
* Multiple serialization formats to communicate data between applications

### Data Model
JSON data types plus binary.  Abstract, independent of programming language and software technique.

### Schema mechanism
Enumeration, choice, CDDL composition styles, and value constraints

### Schema Formats
JSON, Structure Tables, Data Definition Languages (ASN.1-ish, Thrift-ish, YANG-ish)

### Serialization
JSON, M-JSON, CBOR, XML
