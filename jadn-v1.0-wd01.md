### Abstract:
JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language based on the CBOR data model. It has several purposes, including definition of data structures, validation of data instances, providing hints for user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as property tables and text-based data definition languages, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.

# 1 Introduction

Standards may be developed using data definition tables with the goal of being agnostic of transfer format, but no well-defined mechanism exists for achieving that goal. JADN is a schema language with definitions that can be both validated for correctness and documented in table format, ensuring that the table content is valid. A JADN schema is executable byte code that can be transferred between applications, interpreted to validate application data, and embedded to produce self-describing data.

Numerous data definition languages are in use. JADN is not intended to replace any of them, but serves as a Rosetta stone to facilitate translation among them.  In particular, a high-level JADN specification can be translated into languages such as XML Schema Definition and JSON Schema. 

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.2 Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] and [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 1.3 Definitions

### 1.3.1 Schema
An abstract schema, or information model, describes the structure and value constraints of information used by applications.

A concrete schema, or data model, describes the structure and value constraints of a document used to store or communicate information.

### 1.3.2 Document
A document is a series of octets described by an information model and a data format, or equivalently, by a data model.

### 1.3.3 Well-formed
A well-formed document follows the syntactic structure of the document's media type.

### 1.3.4 Valid
An instance is valid if it satisfies the constraints defined in a schema.

A document is valid if it is well-formed and also decodes into a valid instance.

### 1.3.5 Data Format
A data format, defined by serialization rules, specifies the media type (e.g., application/xml, application/json, application/cbor), design goals (e.g., human readability, efficiency), and style preferences for documents in that format. This specification defines XML, JSON, M-JSON, and CBOR data formats. Additional data formats may be defined for any media types that can represent instances of the JADN information model.

Serialization rules for a data format define how instances of each type are represented in documents of that format.

### 1.3.6 Instance
An instance, or API value, is an item of application information to which a schema applies. An instance has one of the core types defined in [Section 3](#3-jadn-types), and a set of possible values depending on the type. The core types are:

* **Simple:** Null, Boolean, Binary, Integer, Number, String
* **Selector:** Enumerated, Choice
* **Compound:** Array, ArrayOf(value_type), Map, MapOf(key_type, value_type), Record.

Since mapping types cannot have two fields with the same key, behavior for a JADN document that tries to define an instance having two fields with the same key is undefined.

Note that JADN schemas may define their own extended type system. This should not be confused with the core types defined here. As an example, "IPv4-Address" is a reasonable extended type for a schema to define, but the definition is based on the Binary core type.

#### 1.3.6.1 Instance Equality
Two JADN instances are said to be equal if and only if they are of the same core type and have the same value according to the information model.  Mere formatting differences, including a document's data format, are insignificant.  An IPv4 address serialized as a JSON dotted-quad is equal to an IPv4 address serialized as a CBOR byte string if and only if they have the same 32 bit value.  Two Record instances are equal if and only if each field in one has exactly one field with a key equal to the other's, and that other field has an equal value.  Because Record keys are ordered, an instance serialized as an array in one document can be compared for equality with an instance serialized as a map in another.

### 1.3.7 Serialization
Serialization, or encoding, is the process of converting application information into a document.  De-serialization, or decoding, converts a document into an instance usable by an application.

### 1.3.8 Description
Description elements are reserved for comments from schema authors to readers or maintainers of the schema, and are ignored by applications using the schema.

# 2 Information vs. Data
JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language. 
[RFC 3444](#rfc3444) describes the difference between an information model (IM) and a data model (DM):
* The main purpose of an IM is to model managed objects at a conceptual level,
independent of any specific implementations or protocols used to transport
the data.
* DMs, conversely, are defined at a lower level of abstraction and include
many details. They are intended for implementors and include protocol-specific
constructs.
```
             IM                --> conceptual/abstract model
              |                    for designers and operators
   +----------+---------+
   |          |         |
   DM        DM         DM     --> concrete/detailed model
                                   for implementors
```
Since conceptual models can be implemented in different ways, multiple DMs
can be derived from a single IM.

Information is *what* needs to be communicated between applications, and data is *how* that information
is represented when communicating.  More formally, information is the unexpected data, or "entropy",
contained in a document.  When information is serialized for transmission in a canonical format, the additional
data used for purposes such as text conversion, delimiting, and framing contains no information because it is known a priori.
If the serialization is non-canonical, any additional entropy introduced during serialization
(e.g., whitespace, leading zeroes, field reordering, case-insensitive capitalization) is discarded on deserialization.

A variable that can take on 2^N different values conveys at most N bits of information.
For example, an IPv4 address that can specify 2^32 different addresses is, by definition,
a 32 bit value*.  But different data may be used to represent that information:
* IPv4 dotted-quad contained in a JSON string: "192.168.141.240" (17 bytes / 136 bits).
* IPv4 dotted-quad contained in a CBOR string: 0x6F3139322E3136382E3134312E323430 (16 bytes / 128 bits)
* Hex value contained in a JSON string: "C0A88DF0" (10 bytes / 80 bits)
* CBOR byte string: 0x44c0a88df0 (5 bytes / 40 bits).
* IPv4 packet: 0xc0a88df0 (4 bytes / 32 bits).

The 13 extra bytes used to format a 4 byte IP address as a dotted quad are useful for display purposes,
but provide no information to the receiving application. Directly converting display-oriented JSON data to
CBOR format does not achieve the conciseness for which CBOR was designed. Instead, information modeling
is the key to effectively using CBOR and other concise data formats.

\* *Note: all references to information assume independent uniformly-distributed values.*
*Source coding is beyond the scope of this specification.*

## 2.1 Information Modeling

JADN is based on the [CBOR](#rfc7049) data model ([JSON](#rfc8259) types plus integers, special numbers, and byte strings), but has an
information-centric focus:

| Data-centric | Information-centric |
| --- | --- |
| A data definition language is designed around specific data formats. | An information modeling language is designed to express application needs. |
| Serialization-specific details are built into applications. | Serialization is a communication function like compression and encryption, provided to applications. |
| JSON Schema defines integer as a value constraint on the JSON number type: "integer matches any number with a zero fractional part". | Distinct Integer and Number core types exist regardless of data representation. |
| CDDL says: "While arrays and maps are only two representation formats, they are used to specify four loosely-distinguishable styles of composition". | Core container types are based on five distinct composition styles.  Each type can be represented in multiple data formats. |
| No table composition style is defined. | Tables are a fundamental way of organizing information. The Record core type contains tabular information that can be represented as either arrays or maps in multiple data formats. |
| Instance equality is defined at the data level. | Instance equality is defined at the information level. |
| Data-centric design is often Anglocentric, embedding English-language identifiers in protocol data. | Information-centric design encourages definition of natural-language-agnostic protocols while supporting localized text identifiers within applications. |

## 2.2 Implementation

Two general approaches can be used to implement IM-based protocol specifications:
1) Translate the IM to a data-format-specific schema language such [Relax-NG](#relaxng), [JSON Schema](#jsonschema), [Protobuf](#proto), or [CDDL](#rfc8610), then use format-specific serialization and validation libraries to process data in the selected format. Applications use data objects specific to each serialization format.
2) Use the IM directly as a format-independent schema language, using IM serialization and validation libraries to process data without a separate schema generation step. Applications use the same IM instances regardless of serialization format, making it easy to bridge from one format to another.
 
Implementations based on serialization-specific code interoperate with those using an IM serialization library, allowing developers to use either approach. 

# 3 JADN Types
JADN core types are defined in terms of the characteristics they provide to applications. For example, the Map type does not guarantee that elements will not be reordered.  An application that implements Map using an order-preserving variable type must interoperate with applications that do not preserve element order.
* An application that uses JADN types MUST exhibit the behavior specified in Table 3-1.
Applications MAY use any programming language data types or mechanisms that exhibit the required behavior.

###### Table 3-1. JADN Types

|    JADN Type     |       Definition                                                |
| :--------------  | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Simple**      |                                                                 |
| Binary           | A sequence of octets.  Length is the number of octets.          |
| Boolean          | An element with one of two values: true or false.               |
| Integer          | A positive or negative whole number.                            |
| Number           | A real number.                                                  |
| Null             | An unspecified or non-existent value, distinguishable from other values such as empty String or Array. |
| String           | A sequence of characters, each of which has a Unicode codepoint.  Length is the number of characters. |
|  **Selector**    |                                                                 |
| Enumerated       | One value selected from a set of named or labeled integers.     |
| Choice           | One key and value selected from a set of named or labeled fields. The key has an id and name or label, and is mapped to a type. |
| **Compound**     |                                                                 |
| Array            | An ordered list of labeled fields with positionally-defined semantics. Each field has a position, label, and type. |
| ArrayOf(*vtype*) | An ordered list of fields with the same semantics. Each field has a position and type *vtype*. |
| Map              | An unordered map from a set of specified keys to values with semantics bound to each key. Each key has an id and name or label, and is mapped to a type. |
| MapOf(*ktype*, *vtype*) | An unordered map from a set of keys of the same type to values with the same semantics. Each key has key type *ktype*, and is mapped to value type *vtype*. |
| Record          | An ordered map from a list of keys with positions to values with positionally-defined semantics. Each key has a position and name, and is mapped to a type. Represents a row in a spreadsheet or database table. |

**API Values**

The mechanisms chosen by a developer or defined by an IM library to represent instances of these types within an application constitute an application programming interface (API). JADN types are the single point of convergence between multiple programming language APIs and multiple serialization formats -- any programming mechanisms and any data formats that exhibit the behavior required of a type are interchangeable and interoperable.

## 3.1 Type Definitions
JADN type definitions have a regular structure designed to be easily describable, easily processed, stable, and extensible. Every definition creates a *Defined type* that has four elements, plus for most compound types, a list of fields:

1. **TypeName:** the name of the type being defined
2. **BaseType:** the JADN type ([Table 3-1](#table-3-1-jadn-types)) of the type being defined
3. **TypeOptions:** an array of zero or more **TypeOption** ([Table 3-2](#table-3-2-type-options)) applicable to the type being defined
4. **TypeDescription:** a non-normative comment
5. **Fields:** an array of one or more field definitions, if applicable to BaseType

* TypeName MUST NOT be a JADN type.
* BaseType MUST be a JADN type.
* If BaseType is a Simple type, ArrayOf, or MapOf, the type definition MUST NOT include Fields:
```
[TypeName, BaseType, [TypeOption, ...], TypeDescription]
```

* If BaseType is Enumerated, each item definition MUST have three elements:

1. **ItemID:** the integer identifier of the item
2. **ItemValue:** the value of the item
3. **ItemDescription:** a non-normative comment
```
[TypeName, BaseType, [TypeOption, ...], TypeDescription, [
    [ItemID, ItemValue, ItemDescription],
    ...
]]
```
* If BaseType is Array, Choice, Map, or Record, each field definition MUST have five elements:

1. **FieldID:** the integer identifier of the field
2. **FieldName:** the name or label of the field
3. **FieldType:** the type of the field, TypeName with optional Namespace ID prefix **NSID:TypeName**
4. **FieldOptions:** an array of zero or more **FieldOption** ([Table 3-5](#table-3-5-field-options)) or **TypeOption** ([Table 3-2](#table-3-2-type-options)) applicable to the field
5. **FieldDescription:** a non-normative comment
```
[TypeName, BaseType, [TypeOption, ...], TypeDescription, [
    [FieldID, FieldName, FieldType, [FieldOption, TypeOption, ...], FieldDescription],
    ...
]]
```
* FieldID and FieldName values MUST be unique within a type definition.
* If BaseType is Array or Record, FieldID MUST be the position of the field within the type, numbered consecutively starting at 1.
* If BaseType is Enumerated, Choice, or Map, FieldID MAY be any nonconflicting integer tag.
* FieldType MUST be a Simple type, ArrayOf, MapOf, or a Defined type.
* If FieldType is not a JADN Type, FieldOptions MUST NOT contain any TypeOption.

Including TypeOption values within FieldOptions is an extension ([Section 3.3.1](#331-type-definition-within-fields)).

### 3.1.1 Name Formats
JADN does not restrict the syntax of TypeName and FieldName, but naming conventions can aid readability of specifications.

* JADN specifications MAY override the default name formats by defining one or more of:
    * The permitted format for TypeName
    * The permitted format for FieldName
    * A Field Separator character used in field pathnames
    * A "System" character used in tool-generated or specially-processed type names
    * The permitted format for the Namespace Identifier (NSID) used in type references
* Schema authors MUST NOT create FieldNames containing the Field Separator character
* Schema authors SHOULD NOT create TypeNames containing the System character, but schema processing tools MAY do so
* Specifications that do not define alternate name formats MUST use the definitions in Figure 3-1 expressed as [ABNF](#rfc5234) and [Regular Expression](#es9):
```
ABNF:
TypeName   = UC *31("-" / Sys / UC / LC / DIGIT)    ; e.g., Color-Values, length = 1-32 characters
FieldName  = LC *31("_" / UC / LC / DIGIT)          ; e.g., color_values, length = 1-32 characters
NSID       = (UC / LC) *7(UC / LC / DIGIT)          ; Namespace ID e.g., td, length = 1-8 characters

FS         = "/"      ; 'SOLIDUS', Separator between components of field pathnames, e.g., color/values
Sys        = "$"      ; 'DOLLAR SIGN', Character used in tool-generated type names, e.g., Color$values.
UC         = %x41-5A  ; A-Z
LC         = %x61-7A  ; a-z
DIGIT      = %x30-39  ; 0-9

Regular Expression:
TypeName:  ^[A-Z][-$A-Za-z0-9]{0,31}$
FieldName: ^[a-z][_A-Za-z0-9]{0,31}$
NSID:      ^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]{0,7}$
```
###### Figure 3-1: JADN Default Name Syntax in ABNF and Regular Expression Formats

Specifications MAY use the same syntax for TypeName and FieldName. Using distinct formats may aid understanding but
does not affect the meaning of type definitions.

### 3.1.2 Upper Bounds
Type definitions based on variable-length types may include maximum size limits. If an individual type does not define an explicit limit, it uses the default limit defined by the specification.  If the specification does not define a default, the definition uses the limits shown here, which are deliberately conservative to encourage specification authors to define limits based on application requirements.
* JADN specifications SHOULD define size limits on the variable-length values shown in Figure 3-2.
* Specifications that do not define alternate size limits MUST use the values shown in Figure 3-2.
* An instance MUST be considered invalid if its size exceeds the limit specified in its type definition, or the default limit defined in the specification containing its type definition, or if the specification does not define a default, the limit shown in Figure 3-2.

```
Type                Name         Limit   Description
-----               -----        -----   -----------
Binary              MaxBinary    255     Maximum number of octets
String              MaxString    255     Maximum number of characters
Array, ArrayOf,     MaxElements  100     Maximum number of items/properties
Map, MapOf, Record
```

### 3.1.3 Definition Formats

JADN type definitions are themselves information objects that can be represented in many ways.
[Section 5](#5-definition-formats) defines two styles (JADN-IDL and table) that can represent JADN definitions
in a format that is more readable than JSON data.

The [Protobuf](#proto) introduction has an example Person structure with three fields, the third of which is optional:

**Protobuf definition of Person:**
```
message Person {
  required string name = 1;
  required int32 id = 2;
  optional string email = 3;
}
```

The equivalent JADN definition is:

**JADN definition of Person:**
```
["Person", "Record", [], "", [
    [1, "name", "String", [], ""],
    [2, "id", "Integer", [], ""],
    [3, "email", "String", ["[0"], ""]
]]
```

**JADN definition of Person in JADN-IDL format ([Section 5.1](#51-jadn-idl-format)):**
```
Person = Record {
  1 name   String,
  2 id     Integer,
  3 email  String optional
}
```

**JADN definition of Person in table style ([Section 5.2](#52-table-style)):**

  *Type: Person (Record)*

|  ID  |    Name   |   Type  |   #  | Description |
| ---: | --------- | ------- | ---: | ----------- |
|   1  | **name**  | String  |    1 |             |
|   2  | **id**    | Integer |    1 |             |
|   3  | **email** | String  | 0..1 |             |

These represent the same IM definition, but conformance is based on native JSON definitions. Specifications that use JADN-IDL or table format SHOULD also make those definitions available in JADN format (see [Appendix D](#appendix-d-definitions-in-jadn-format)).

### 3.1.4 Descriptions
Description elements (TypeDescription, ItemDescription and FieldDescription) are reserved for comments from schema authors to readers or maintainers of the schema.
* The description value MUST be a string, which MAY be empty.
* Implementations MUST NOT present this string to end users.
* Tools for editing schemas SHOULD support displaying and editing descriptions.
* Implementations MUST NOT take any other action based on the presence, absence, or content of description values.

Description values MAY be used in debug or error output which is intended for developers making use of schemas. Tools that translate other media types or programming languages to and from a JADN schema MAY choose to convert that media type or programming language's native comments to or from description values. Implementations MAY strip description values at any point during processing.

## 3.2 Options
This section defines the mechanism used to support a varied set of information needs within the strictly regular
structure of [Section 3.1](#31-type-definitions). New requirements can be accommodated by defining new options
without modifying that structure.

Each option is a text string that may be included in TypeOptions or FieldOptions. The first character of the string
is the option ID as defined in [Table 3-2](#table-3-2-type-options) and [Table 3-5](#table-3-5-field-options).
The remaining characters are the value of that option, if any.

### 3.2.1 Type Options
Type options apply to the type definition as a whole. Structural options are intrinsic elements of the types
defined in ([Table 3-1](#table-3-1-jadn-types)). Validation options are optional; if present they constrain
which data values are instances of the defined type.

###### Table 3-2. Type Options

| ID | Label | Value | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Structural** | | | |
| 0x3d `'='` | id | none | If present, Enumerated values and fields of compound types are denoted by FieldID rather than FieldName ([Section 3.2.1.1](#3211-field-identifiers)) |
| 0x2a `'*'` | vtype | String | Value type for ArrayOf and MapOf ([Section 3.2.1.2](#3212-value-type)) |
| 0x2b `'+'` | ktype | String | Key type for MapOf ([Section 3.2.1.3](#3213-key-type)) |
| 0x24 `'$'` | enum | String | Extension: Enumerated type derived from the specified Array, Choice, Map or Record type ([Section 3.3.3](#333-derived-enumerations)) |
| **Validation** | | | |
| 0x2f `'/'` | format | String | Semantic validation keyword from [Section 3.2.1.5](#3215-semantic-validation) |
| 0x25 `'%'` | pattern | String | Regular expression used to validate a String type ([Section 3.2.1.6](#3216-pattern)) |
| 0x7b `'{'` | minv | Integer | Minimum numeric value, octet or character count, or element count ([Section 3.2.1.7](#3217-size-and-value-constraints)) |
| 0x7d `'}'` | maxv | Integer | Maximum numeric value, octet or character count, or element count |
| 0x71 `'q'` | unique | none | If present, an ArrayOf instance must not contain duplicate values |

* TypeOptions MUST contain zero or one instance of each type option.
* TypeOptions MUST contain only TypeOptions allowed for BaseType as shown in Table 3-3.
* If BaseType is ArrayOf, TypeOptions MUST include the *vtype* option.
* If BaseType is MapOf, TypeOptions MUST include *ktype* and *vtype* options.

###### Table 3-3. Allowed Options

| BaseType | Allowed Options |
| :--- | :--- |
| Binary | minv, maxv, format |
| Boolean | |
| Integer | minv, maxv, format |
| Number | minv, maxv, format |
| Null | |
| String | minv, maxv, format, pattern |
| Enumerated | id, enum |
| Choice | id |
| Array | minv, maxv, format |
| ArrayOf | vtype, minv, maxv, unique |
| Map | id, minv, maxv |
| MapOf | ktype, vtype, minv, maxv |
| Record | minv, maxv |

#### 3.2.1.1 Field Identifiers

The *id* option used with Enumerated, Choice, and Map types determines how fields are specified in API instances of these types.
If the *id* option is absent, API instances use FieldName and the type is referred to as "named".
If the *id* option is present, API instances use FieldID and the type is referred to as "labeled".
The Record type is always named and has no *id* option; the Array type is its labeled equivalent.
* In named types, FieldName is a defined name that is included in the semantics of the type, must be
populated in the type definition, and may appear in serialized data depending on serialization format.
* In labeled types, FieldName is a suggested label that is not included in the semantics of the type,
may be empty in the type definition, and never appears in serialized data regardless of data format.

For example an Enumerated list of HTTP status codes could include the field [403, "Forbidden"].
If the type definition does not include an *id* option, the API value is "Forbidden" and serialization rules determine
whether FieldID or FieldName is used in serialized data. With the *id* option the API and serialized values are always
the FieldID 403. The label "Forbidden" may be displayed in messages or user interfaces, as could customized labels
such as "NotAllowed", "Verboten", or "Interdit".

#### 3.2.1.2 Value Type

The *vtype* option specifies the type of each field in an ArrayOf or MapOf type. It may be any JADN type or Defined type.
* An ArrayOf or MapOf instance MUST be considered invalid if any of its elements is not an instance of *vtype*.

#### 3.2.1.3 Key Type
The *ktype* option specifies the type of each key in a MapOf type. 
* *ktype* SHOULD be a Defined type, either an enumeration or a type with constraints such as a pattern or semantic valuation keyword that specify a fixed subset of values that belong to a category.
* A MapOf instance MUST be considered invalid if any of its keys is not an instance of *ktype*.

#### 3.2.1.4 Derived Enumeration
The *enum* option is an extension that creates an Enumerated type derived from a referenced
Array, Choice, Map or Record type. (See [Section 3.3.3](#333-derived-enumerations)).

#### 3.2.1.5 Semantic Validation
The *format* option value is a semantic validation keyword. Each keyword specifies validation requirements for
a fixed subset of values that are accurately described by authoritative resources.  The *format* option may also
affect how values are serialized, see [Section 4](#4-serialization).

###### Table 3-4. Semantic Validation Keywords
| Keyword      | Type   | Requirement |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------|
| JSON Schema formats | String | All semantic validation keywords defined in Section 7.3 of [JSON Schema](#jsonschema). |
| eui          | Binary | IEEE Extended Unique Identifier (MAC Address), EUI-48 or EUI-64 as specified in [EUI](#eui) |
| ipv4-addr    | Binary | IPv4 address as specified in [RFC 791](#rfc791) Section 3.1 |
| ipv6-addr    | Binary | IPv6 address as specified in [RFC 8200](#rfc8200)  Section 3 |
| ipv4-net     | Array  | Binary IPv4 address and Integer prefix length as specified in [RFC 4632](#rfc4632) Section 3.1 |
| ipv6-net     | Array  | Binary IPv6 address and Integer prefix length as specified in [RFC 4291](#rfc4291) Section 2.3 |
| i8           | Integer | Signed 8 bit integer, value must be between -128 and 127.
| i16          | Integer | Signed 16 bit integer, value must be between -32768 and 32767.
| i32          | Integer | Signed 32 bit integer, value must be between -2147483648 and 2147483647.
| u\<*n*\>     | Integer | Unsigned integer or bit field of \<*n*\> bits, value must be between 0 and 2^\<*n*\> - 1.

#### 3.2.1.6 Pattern
The *pattern* option specifies a regular expression used to validate a String instance.
* The *pattern* value SHOULD conform to the Pattern grammar of [ECMAScript](#es9) Section 21.2.
* A String instance MUST be considered invalid if it does not match the regular expression specified by *pattern*.

#### 3.2.1.7 Size and Value Constraints
The *minv* and *maxv* options specify size or value limits.

* For Binary, String, Array, ArrayOf, Map, MapOf, and Record types:
    * if *minv* is not present, it defaults to zero.
    * if *maxv* is not present or is zero, it defaults to the upper bound specified in [Section 3.1.2](3-1-2-upper-bounds).
    * a Binary instance MUST be considered invalid if its number of bytes is less than *minv* or greater than *maxv*.
    * a String instance MUST be considered invalid if its number of characters is less than *minv* or greater than *maxv*.
    * an Array, ArrayOf, Map, MapOf, or Record instance MUST be considered invalid if its number of elements is less than *minv* or greater than *maxv*.

* For Integer and Number types:
    * if *minv* is present, an instance MUST be considered invalid if its value is less than *minv*.
    * if *maxv* is present, an instance MUST be considered invalid if its value is greater than *maxv*.

#### 3.2.1.8 Unique Values
The *unique* option specifies that values in an array must not be repeated.

* For the ArrayOf type, if *unique* is present, an instance MUST be considered invalid if it contains duplicate values.

### 3.2.2 Field Options
Field options are specified for each field within a type definition. Each option in Table 3-5 is a structural element of the type definition.

###### Table 3-5. Field Options

| ID | Label | Value | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x5b `'['` | minc | Integer | Minimum cardinality |
| 0x5d `']'` | maxc | Integer | Maximum cardinality |
| 0x26 `'&'` | tfield | Enumerated | Field that specifies the type of this field |
| 0x3c `'<'` | path | none | Use FieldName as a qualifier for fields in FieldType |
| 0x21 `'!'` | default | String | Reserved for default value [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-default-value))|

* FieldOptions MUST NOT include more than one of: a minc/maxc range, tfield, or path.  
* All type options ([Table 3-2](#table-3-2-type-options)) included in FieldOptions MUST apply to FieldType as defined in [Table 3-3](#table-3-3-allowed-options). 

#### 3.2.2.1 Multiplicity
Multiplicity, as used in the Unified Modeling Language ([UML](#uml)), is a range of allowed cardinalities.
The *minc* and *maxc* options specify the minimum and maximum cardinality (number of elements) in a field
of an Array, Choice, Map, or Record type:

| minc | maxc | Multiplicity | Description | Keywords |
| ---: | ---: | -----------: | :---------- | :------- |
|    0 |    1 | 0..1 | No instances or one instance | optional |
|    1 |    1 |    1 | Exactly one instance | required |
|    0 |    0 | 0..* | Zero or more instances | optional, repeated |
|    1 |    0 | 1..* | At least one instance | required, repeated |
|    m |    n | m..n | At least m but no more than n instances | required, repeated if m > 1 |

* if *minc* is not present, it defaults to 1.
* if *maxc* is not present, it defaults to the greater of 1 or *minc*.
* if *maxc* is 0, it defaults to the MaxElements upper bound specified in [Section 3.1.2](#312-upper-bounds).
* if *maxc* is less than *minc*, the field definition MUST be considered invalid.

If minc is 0, the field is optional, otherwise it is required.  
If maxc is 1 the field is a single element, otherwise it is an array of elements.  

A field definition with minc other than 0 or 1, or maxc other than 1, is an extension described in [Section 3.3.2](#332-field-multiplicity).

Within a Choice type minc values of 0 and 1 are equivalent because all fields are optional and exactly one must be present. Values greater than 1 specify an array of elements.

#### 3.2.2.2 Referenced Field Type
A field may include the *tfield* option to specify another field within the same container
type that controls which Choice element is used.

* The *tfield* option MUST NOT appear in a field where FieldType does not refer to a Choice type.
* The *tfield* option MUST NOT appear in a type where BaseType is not Array, Map, or Record.

**Example:**

    Department = Choice {
        1 furniture   Furniture,
        2 kitchen     Appliance,
        3 electronics Device
    }
    DeptID = Enumerated {
        1 furniture,
        2 kitchen,
        3 electronics
    }
    Product = Array {
        1 dept        DeptID,             // Must be a valid Choice field
        2 quantity    Integer,
        3 details     Department(&dept)   // Field that selects which Choice element must be present
    }

#### 3.2.2.3 Field Pathnames
Fields where FieldType is Enumerated, Choice, Map, or Record may include the *path* option.
Field names of the nested definition are qualified by the enclosing field name to prevent collisions,
forming a relative path using the field separator (FS - [Section 3.1.1](#311-name-formats)) character.

A pathname is equivalent to a JSON pointer ([RFC 6901](#rfc6901)), which begins with a reference
to the root value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value within the document.
A pathname instance is a reference to a type followed by the name of a field within the referenced type.

Pathnames may be used to aggregate separately-defined sets of fields, or to
apply constraints such as a choice of subfields within a larger set of fields.

**Example:**

With the type definitions:

    Palette = Map {
        1 burgundy Rgb,
        2 grass    Rgb,
        3 lapis    Rgb,
        4 new/     New-Color    // "new/" is a reference to the root of New-Color
    }
    New-Color = Map {
       17 maize    Rgb,
        9 fuschia  Rgb,
        2 aqua     Rgb
    }
    Rgb = Record {
        1 red      Integer{0..255},
        2 green    Integer{0..255},
        3 blue     Integer{0..255}
    }

an API value of Palette: 

    {'grass': {'red': 32, 'green': 240, 'blue': 24}, 'new/aqua': {'red': 64, 'green': 240, 'blue': 192}}

is serialized in JSON format using qualified field names as:

    87 non-whitespace bytes:
    {
      "grass": {
        "red": 32,
        "green": 240,
        "blue": 24
      },
      "new/aqua": {
        "red": 64,
        "green": 240,
        "blue": 192
      }
    }

and is serialized in M-JSON and CBOR formats, nested because pathname strings are not used, as:

                M-JSON value:  [2, [32, 240, 24], 4, [2, [64, 240, 192]]]
    CBOR diagnostic notation:  {2: [32, 240, 24], 4: {2: [64, 240, 192]}}
    
    19 bytes:
    A2             # map(2)
       02          # unsigned(2) -- grass
       83          # array(3)
          18 20    # unsigned(32)  -- red
          18 F0    # unsigned(240) -- green
          18 18    # unsigned(24)  -- blue
       04          # unsigned(4) -- new
       A1          # map(1)
          02       # unsigned(2) -- aqua
          83       # array(3)
             18 40 # unsigned(64)  -- red
             18 F0 # unsigned(240) -- green
             18 C0 # unsigned(192) -- blue

#### 3.2.2.4 Default Value
The *default* option is reserved for future use. It is intended to specify the value a receiving application uses for an optional field if an instance does not include its value.

## 3.3 JADN Extensions
JADN consists of a set of core definition types, plus several extensions that make type definitions
more compact or that support the [DRY](#dry) software design principle.
Extensions can be "simplified" (replaced by core definitions) without affecting
the meaning of the definition. Simplifying reduces the code needed to serialize and validate data
and may make specifications easier to understand.  But it creates additional definitions that must
be kept in sync, expanding the specification and increasing maintenance effort.

The following extensions can be converted to core definitions:
* Anonymous type definition within a field
* Field multiplicity other than required/optional
* Derived enumeration
* MapOf type with Enumerated key type

### 3.3.1 Type Definition Within Fields
A type without fields (Simple types, ArrayOf, MapOf) may be defined anonymously within a field of a structure definition.
Simplifying converts all anonymous type definitions to explicit named types and excludes all type options
([Table 3-2](#table-3-2-type-options)) from FieldOptions.

Example:

    Member = Record {
        1 name  String,
        2 email String /idn-email
    }

Simplifying replaces this with:

    Member = Record {
        1 name   String,
        2 email  Member$email             // Name and field options only, no type options
    }
    Member$email = String /idn-email      // Tool-generated type definition.

### 3.3.2 Field Multiplicity
Fields may be defined to have multiple values of the same type. Simplifying converts each field that can
have more than one value to a separate ArrayOf type. The minimum and maximum cardinality (minc and maxc)
FieldOptions ([Table 3-5](#table-3-5-field-options)) are moved from FieldOptions to the minimum and maximum
size (minv and maxv) TypeOptions of the new ArrayOf type, except that if minc is 0
(field is optional), it remains in FieldOptions and the new ArrayOf type defaults to a minimum
size of 1.

Example:

    Roster = Record {
        1 org_name String,
        2 members  Member[0..*]               // Optional and repeated: minc=0, maxc=0
    }

Simplifying replaces this with:

    Roster = Record {
        1 org_name String,
        2 members  Roster$members optional    // Optional: minc=0, maxc=1
    }
    Roster$members = ArrayOf(Member){1..*}    // Tool-generated array: minv=1, maxv=0

If a list with no elements should be represented as an empty array rather than omitted,
its type definition must include an explicit ArrayOf type rather than using the
field multiplicity extension:

    Roster = Record {
        1 org_name String,
        2 members  Members                    // members field is required: default minc = 1, maxc = 1
    }
    Members = ArrayOf(Member)                 // Explicitly-defined array: default minv = 0, maxv = 0

### 3.3.3 Derived Enumerations
An Enumerated type defined with the *enum* option has fields copied from the type referenced
in the option rather than being listed individually in the definition.
Simplifying removes *enum* from Type Options and adds fields containing
FieldID, FieldName, and FieldDescription from each field of the referenced type.

In JADN-IDL ([Section 5.1](#51-jadn-idl-format)) format the *enum* option is represented
as a function string: "Enum(\<referenced-type\>)".
Within ArrayOf and MapOf types, the *ktype* and *vtype* option values are "Enum()" function
strings.

Simplifying references an explicit Enumerated type if it exists, otherwise it creates an explicit
Enumerated type. It then replaces the type reference with the name of the explicit Enumerated type.

Example:

    Pixel = Map {
        1 red   Integer,
        2 green Integer,
        3 blue  Integer
    }
    Channel = Enumerated(Enum(Pixel))       // Derived Enumerated type
    ChannelMask = ArrayOf(Enum(Pixel))      // ArrayOf(derived enumeration)

Simplifying replaces the Channel and ChannelMask definitions with:

    Channel = Enumerated {
        1 red,
        2 green,
        3 blue
    }
    ChannelMask = ArrayOf(Channel)

### 3.3.4 MapOf With Enumerated Key
A MapOf type where *ktype* is Enumerated is equivalent to a Map.  Simplifying replaces the MapOf type definition
with a Map type with keys from the Enumerated *ktype*. This is the complementary operation to derived
enumeration. In order to use this extension, each ItemValue of the Enumerated type must be a valid FieldName.

Example:

    Channel = Enumerated {
        1 red,
        2 green,
        3 blue
    }
    Pixel = MapOf(Channel, Integer)
    
Simplifying replaces the Pixel MapOf with the explicit Pixel Map shown above.

# 4 Serialization
Applications may use any internal information representation that exhibits the characteristics defined in [Table 3-1](#table-3-1-jadn-types). Serialization rules define how to represent instances of each type using a specific format. Several serialization formats are defined in this section. In order to be usable with JADN, serialization formats defined elsewhere must:
* Specify an unambiguous serialized representation for each JADN type
* Specify how each option applicable to a type affects serialized values
* Specify any validation requirements defined for that format

## 4.1 JSON Serialization
The following serialization rules are used to represent JADN data types in a human-friendly JSON format.

* When using JSON serialization, instances of JADN types without a format option listed in this section MUST be serialized as:

| JADN Type | JSON Serialization Requirement |

# 5 Definition Formats

[Section 3.1](#31-type-definitions) defines the native JSON format of JADN type definitions.
Although JSON data is unambiguous and supported in many programming languages, it is cumbersome
to use as a documentation format. This section defines two alternative ways of documenting JADN information
models - a formal text-based interface definition language and an example property table layout.
In addition, tree diagrams can be used to provide a high-level overview of JADN information models.

### 5.1 JADN-IDL Format

JADN Interface Definition Language (IDL) is a textual representation of JADN type definitions.
It replicates the structure of [Section 3.1](#31-type-definitions) but combines each type
and its options into a single string formatted for readability.
The conversion between JSON and JADN-IDL formats is lossless in both directions.

The JADN-IDL definition formats are:

Simple types:
```
    TypeName = TYPESTRING                     // TypeDescription
```

Enumerated type:
```
    TypeName = TYPESTRING {                   // TypeDescription
        ItemID ItemValue,                     // ItemDescription
        ...
    }
```

Compound types without the *id* option:
```
    TypeName = TYPESTRING {                   // TypeDescription
        FieldID FieldName[FS] FIELDSTRING,    // FieldDescription
        ...
    }
```
If a field includes the *path* FieldOption, the Field Separator character (FS - [Section 3.1.1](#311-name-formats))
is appended to FieldName.

Compound types with the *id* option treat the item/field name as a non-normative label
(see [Section 3.2.1.1](#3211-field-identifiers)) and display it in the description
followed by a label terminator ("::"):
```
    /* Enumerated.ID */
    TypeName = TYPESTRING {                   // TypeDescription
        ItemID                                // ItemValue:: ItemDescription
    }
    
    /* Choice.ID, Map.ID */
    TypeName = TYPESTRING {                   // TypeDescription
        FieldID FIELDSTRING,                  // FieldName[FS]:: FieldDescription
        ...
    }
```

**Type Options:**

TYPESTRING is the value of BaseType or FieldType, followed by string representations of the type options,
if applicable to TYPE as specified in [Table 3-3](#table-3-3-allowed-options).

    TYPESTRING    = TYPE [".ID"] [S1] [VRANGE] [FORMAT]   ; TYPE is the value of BaseType or FieldType
    S1            = "(" *ktype* "," *vtype* ")"           ; if TYPE is MapOf
                  | "(" *vtype* ")"                       ; if TYPE is ArrayOf
                  | "(Enum(" *enum* "))"                  ; if TYPE is Enumerated
                  | "(%" *pattern* "%)"                   ; if TYPE is String
    VRANGE        = "{" *minv* ".." *maxv* "}"
    FORMAT        = " /" *format*

**Field Options:**

FIELDSTRING is the value of TYPESTRING combined with string representations of two mutually-exclusive field options:

    FIELDSTRING   = TYPESTRING [MULTIPLICITY | TFIELD]
    MULTIPLICITY  = "[" *minc* ".." *maxc* "]"
                  | " optional"
    TFIELD        = "(&" *tfield* ")"

An ABNF grammar for JADN-IDL is shown in [Appendix E](#appendix-e-abnf-grammar-for-jadn-idl).

### 5.2 Table Style
Some specifications present type definitions in property table form, using varied style conventions.
This specification does not define a normative property table format, but this section is one example
of how JADN definitions may be displayed as property tables.

This style is structurally similar to JADN-IDL and uses its TYPESTRING syntax, but
breaks out the MULTIPLICITY field option into a separate column:

```
+----------+------------+-----------------+
| TypeName | TYPESTRING | TypeDescription |
+----------+------------+-----------------+
```
followed by (for compound types without the *id* option):
```
+---------+---------------+-------------+--------+------------------+
| FieldID | FieldName[FS] | FIELDSTRING | [m..n] | FieldDescription |
+---------+---------------+-------------+--------+------------------+
```
or (for compound types with the *id* option):
```
+---------+-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
| FieldID | FIELDSTRING | [m..n] | FieldName[FS]:: FieldDescription |
+---------+-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
```
An example property table using this style is shown in [Section 3.1.3](#313-definition-formats).

## 5.3 Tree Diagrams

Tree diagrams provide a simplified graphical overview of an information model.  The structure of a JADN IM
can be displayed as a [YANG tree diagram](#rfc8340) using the following conventions:

# 6 Schemas

JADN schemas are organized into modules.  A schema module includes a set of meta-information (or header) items
and a list of type definitions. Definitions in one module can reference definitions from other modules; this
requires each module to have a unique identifier.

*Editor's note: Describe each Meta field*

# 7 Data Model Generation
A JADN schema combined with serialization rules defines a data model, a concrete schema that validates instances in the specified data format.

# 8 Operational Considerations
* Serialization (bulk vs pull)
* Validation (integrated with serialization, separate)
* Localization
* Schema embedding - self-describing data
* Bridging
* Tabular data (not too many optional columns, sort fields by required/optional.  Tuples.)
-------

# 9 Security Considerations
This document presents a language for expressing the information needs of communicating applications, and rules for generating data structures to satisfy those needs.  As such, it does not inherently introduce security issues, although protocol specifications based on JADN naturally need security analysis when defined. Such specifications need to follow the guidelines in [RFC 3552](#rfc3552).

Additional security considerations applicable to JADN-based specifications: 
* The JADN language could cause confusion in a way that results in security issues. Clarity and unambiguity of this specification could always be improved through operational experience and developer feedback.
* Where a JADN data validator is part of a system, the security of the system benefits from automatic data validation but depends on both the specificity of the JADN specification and the correctness of the validation implementation.  Tightening the specification (e.g., by defining upper bounds and other value constraints) and testing the validator against unreasonable data instances can address both concerns.

Security and bandwidth efficiency are the primary reasons for using an information model. Enumerating strings and map keys defines the information content of those values, which greatly reduces opportunities for exploitation. A firewall with a security policy of "Allow specific things I understand plus everything I don't understand" is less secure than a firewall that allows only things that are understood. The "Must-Ignore" policy of [RFC 7493](#rfc7493) compromises security by allowing everything that is not understood. Information modeling's "Must-Understand" approach enhances security and accommodates new protocol elements by adding them to the IM's enumerated lists of things that are understood. An executable IM format such as JADN provides the agility required to support evolving protocols.

Writers of JADN specifications are strongly encouraged to value simplicity and transparency of the specification over complexity. Although JADN makes it easier to both define and understand complex specifications, complexity that is not essential to satisfying operational requirements is itself a security concern.

# 10 Conformance

(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).

See "Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses":  
http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html.

Remove this note before submitting for publication.)

Conformance targets:

* Core JADN
* JADN Extensions ([Section 3.3](#33-jadn-extensions))
* JADN Schema Translator
    * Validate type definitions per Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
    * Perform type simplification operations per Section 3.3.
    * Translate JSON definitions to Table and JADN-IDL formats per Section 5.1.
    * Merge schema modules per Section 5.2.
* JADN Reverse Schema Translator
    * Translate JADN-IDL definitions to JSON format per Section 5.1.
* JADN Concrete Schema Generator
    * Generate a schema in a format-specific language per serialization rules in Section 4.x.
    Conformance testing requires JADN validator and format-specific validator to agree on all
    good and bad data instances.
* JADN Encoder/Decoder
    * Validate type definition correctness per Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
    * Perform type simplification operations per Section 3.3.
    * Validate API values against type definitions per Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
    * Encode and decode data instances per serialization rules for formats \<X\> and \<Y\> in Section 4.x. 
    Conformance testing requires the implementation under test to support any two serialization formats.

# Appendix C. JADN Meta-schema

A meta-schema is a schema against which other schemas can be validated. The JADN meta-schema validates
itself and other JADN schemas. In order to validate itself, the meta-schema requires a name format change
from the JADN default ([Section 3.1.1](#311-name-formats)):
* FieldName needs to allow configuration variables beginning with '$' and capitalized JADN types  
```
  "config": {
    "$FieldName": "^[$A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]{0,31}$"
  }
```
## C.1 Schema Module

A schema module is a collection of type definitions along with information about the module.
```
