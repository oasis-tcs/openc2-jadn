# README

Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) 
TC create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository 
([https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-lc](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-lc)) as part of the 
TC's chartered work (**i.e.**, the program of work and deliverables described in its
[charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in 
[GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work)
are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), 
[IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies, 
similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  
While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from 
[OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are 
used for development of open source licensed content.

## Description
This repository is for JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN), a UML-based Information Modeling language
used to define data structures independently of data format. The OpenC2 language specification and
actuator profiles are defined using JADN, but JADN is not specific to OpenC2.

This repository will focus on developing an information modeling language and
methodology that is applicable and helpful to any standards development activity.
