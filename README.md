## :blue_book: _JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)_ :blue_book:

The JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) specification defines an
information modeling (IM) language by specifying a vocabulary to
describe the meaning of structured data, to provide hints for
user interfaces working with structured data, and to make
assertions about what a valid instance must look like.

### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Repository Organization :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

![branches](images/repo-branches.png)

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the [current working
  version](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn/blob/working/jadn-v1.0-wd02.md)
  of this work product

More information about the TC's repository organizing conventions
and branching strategy can be found in our [Documentation
Norms](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/Documentation-Norms.md#433-configure-repository).


### :left_speech_bubble: Description :left_speech_bubble:

JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) has several purposes,
including definition of data structures and validation of data
instances. This document specifies a vocabulary to describe the
meaning of structured data, to provide hints for user  interfaces
working with structured data, and to make assertions about what a
valid instance must look like. JADN structure definitions are
format-neutral. Serialization rules define how JADN instances are
represented in specific data formats such as JSON, XML, and CBOR.

### :left_speech_bubble:   Further Description of this Repository :left_speech_bubble: 



This repository is designed to support TC members' work on a

supports development of the content and change tracking for the
JADN specification as new working draft level revisions are
created and the associated CSDs mature.
