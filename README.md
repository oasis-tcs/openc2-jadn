<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/">OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn</a>) as part of the TC's chartered work (<i>i.e.</i>, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php">charter</a>).</p>

<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language based on the CBOR data model. It has several purposes, including definition of data structures, validation of data instances, providing hints for user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as property tables and text-based data definition languages, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.

This repository is designed to support TC members' work on a formal
specification that describes JADN, a tool for defining data structures and
validating data instances. The provisional Work Product title is "Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation, 
Version 1.0", edited by David Kemp (NSA). This GitHub repository supports development of the content and change tracking 
for the JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) specification as new working draft level revisions are created 
and the associated CSDs mature.
